# Mixpanel

Home for the bower version of the official [JavaScript Client](https://mixpanel.com/docs/integration-libraries/javascript).

## Configuration

`<script>mixpanel.init("YOUR TOKEN");</script>`

## Mocking

If you want to leave Mixpanel in some test, you can include `mixpanel.mock.js` instead of `mixpanel.js`. It will print events to console instead of sending them.
